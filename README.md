# electron-sso-saml
Very simple demo of SAML SSO integration from Electron

This was originally created using Okta as the IDP. Logout still doesn't work but I guess you can just close the window.

I'm sure there are lots of better ways to do this without the webview/executeJavascript stuff but it's a working first stab.
